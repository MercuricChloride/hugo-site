<p>I love working on user-respecting technology that exists to solve a problem rather than make a quick profit. So naturally I love Linux and all things FOSS. Nowadays web3 is my main focus for professional and personal work. The technology isn&rsquo;t perfect yet, but the ability for people to conduct business with complex deterministic logic in an adversarial environment without trust or a central authority is an incredibly powerful idea that excites me deeply and inspires me to help push the technology forward.</p>
<p>I was first exposed to cryptocurrencies back in 2013 when Silk Road was shut down. But it wasn&rsquo;t until early 2020 when I started becoming an Ethereum power user that my eyes were truly opened. I learned about smart contracts, defi, and everything else in the space. And once I found Austin Griffith and Scaffold-eth, I was truly hooked. I spent all of my free time building, experimenting, and learning by doing. I believe in rapid prototyping and getting things to market as MVPs, as it allows you to learn so much in a very small amount of time. As a result, I have gathered a large amount of experience in many domains, from building and shipping over 12 projects of my own, helping my colleagues with their own projects, and mentoring new developers. And I have no plans of slowing down.</p>
