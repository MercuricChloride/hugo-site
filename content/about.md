### I'm a fullstack web3 and rust developer.

I love working on user-respecting technology that exists to solve a problem rather than make a quick profit. So naturally I love Linux and all things FOSS. Nowadays web3 is my main focus for professional and personal work. The technology isn't perfect yet, but the ability for people to conduct business with complex deterministic logic in an adversarial environment without trust or a central authority is an incredibly powerful idea that excites me deeply and inspires me to help push the technology forward.

I was first exposed to cryptocurrencies back in 2013 when Silk Road was shut down. But it wasn't until early 2020 when I started becoming an Ethereum power user that my eyes were truly opened. I learned about smart contracts, defi, and everything else in the space. And once I found Austin Griffith and Scaffold-eth, I was truly hooked. I spent all of my free time building, experimenting, and learning by doing. I believe in rapid prototyping and getting things to market as MVPs, as it allows you to learn so much in a very small amount of time. As a result, I have gathered a large amount of experience in many domains, from building and shipping over 12 projects of my own, helping my colleagues with their own projects, and mentoring new developers. And I have no plans of slowing down.

#### If you have a problem that you want to solve I would happy to share my skills and experience to help make it a reality.
